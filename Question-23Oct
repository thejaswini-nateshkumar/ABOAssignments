1: Tell me about a difficult challenge you solved . What was it how did you solve it
 A : The most challenging difficulty I faced in my pervious organization was to understand the flow as it was my first telecom project which I was working on. Later on I started studying the internal documents also watched some vedios online to go through the flow. I worked hard for 2 month contiously and was able to understand the flow and working of the project completly.
Also faced difficult for understanding the different reports which were coming from the clients. Did lot of code analysis and document analysis to understand about the reports and the project.
